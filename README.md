#Retail Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

###Overview
This Power BI project analyzes retail sales, brand performance, and profitability metrics across multiple product brands.  
The dashboard was designed to help identify top-performing brands, cost efficiency, and profit structure within a retail network.

##Dashboard Structure
The report consists of **4 interactive pages**, each serving a specific analytical purpose:

1. **Dashboard Navigation**  
   Clear starting point with quick links to all report sections.

2. **Sales Overview**  
   Focused on total revenue and profit by brand, featuring Pareto analysis and sales structure insights.

3. **Brand Insights**  
   Deep dive into brand-level performance, gross profit, and margin comparisons.

4. ** Profit Analysis**  
   Breakdown of cost vs. revenue, profitability ratios, and contribution of each brand to total gross profit.

- Profitability varies significantly — some brands with high sales show lower margins.  
- Brand E demonstrates steady sales but needs cost optimization to improve margins.  
- The average **profit margin** across all brands is approximately **58%**.
